# Movie Information Web Scraper and Web Application

### Idea

The idea was simple. Although APIs like TMDB, etc. exist to get information about movies, as a fun exercise in working more with E.T.L (extract, translate and load) for database engineering, I decided to build a web scraper that interacted directly with a custom API I developed that will show all movies that are popular, all movies from a client side search parameter and even more information on any movie in my database. This type of project although more on the easy / intermediate side and not too crazy, is super fundamental to how ETL works and also about how to reverse engineer an API and build an app from it.
