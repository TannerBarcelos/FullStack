<body>

  <!--give the divs a class of box such that we can make all boxes a default height/width but then give each 
  a special id such that we can change the color specific to that div, change its position on the page, etc-->
  <div id="box-1" class="box"></div>
  <div id="box-2" class="box"></div>
  <div id="box-3" class="box"></div>
  <div id="box-4" class="box"></div>
  <div id="box-5" class="box"></div>

  <!--
    Position values:
      - Static: Not affected by top,left,right,bottom props/vals
      - Relative: top,left,right,bottom values cause element to be moved from its normal position 
      - Absolute: positioned relative to its parent element if that is positioned relative (i.e: a div positioned
                  relative that contains boxes inside it that can be moved anywhere absolutely in that main div that is relative)
      - Fixed: positioned relative to the viewport (screen on the device viewing the page)
      - Sticky: positioned based on scroll position


    Z-Index: defines the closeness of a element to the user looking at it: z-index of 1 will come to the front
              of any container that had originally covered it
