div:
  - non-semantic (no 'meaning'), used as a container for things
  - is block level

  semantic tags have meaning:
    - <header>  would hold a landing image, maybe an h1 saying some welcome text (nav should definitely not go in header)
    - <footer>  footer like copyright stuff
    - <main>  main content for the page, which can contain any other semantic stuff
    - <section> section of related, important stuff
    - <article> posts, blog stuff
    - <aside> side bar (perfect for sidebar nav)
    - h# 
    etc. ANYTHING THAT HAS MEANING FOR THE PAGE/STUFF WE SEE

span:
  - inline: will just be an inline container for something


spacing:
  - html does NOT accomodate for spacing . if i do :
      tanner is     great
      or 
      tanner is great
      the content would still be -> tanner is great

      to actually tell html to add white space, we do ...
          &nbsp; between the text we want to add x-amount of space to


Entities:
-------------------

> < symbols: the proper way to display greater than and less than symbols
    5 &gt; 2        -> 5 > 2      &gt === #62 in hex (we can use &#g2; hex syntax, but its not common)
    2 &lt; 3        -> 2 < 3      &lt === #60

    copyright symbol === &copy;
    reg symbol === &reg;

    currency:
      cents === &cent;
      pound === &pound;
      yen === &yen;
      euro === &euro;

  we can card suits too (look up, do not feel like noting)
