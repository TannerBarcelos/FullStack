This patten is used quite often. 

Any question that asks about occurences, or frequency, or checking character
matches, or equality in two strings, or arrays, etc. usually indicates using a map!

Map is efficient with O(1) llokup as no duplicate keys are allowed,
which means if you want to add the same key twice, you actually update
the value, or consider some other data storage technique

All coding problems in this section are pretty common jr engineer questions
and also exist on leetcode
