  <h1>Example of links</h1>
  <!--<a></a> tag: this is called an anchor tag: it is used for linking to absolute urls (external sites) or relative urls (files in our directory structure)-->
  <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Go to Google.com</a>
  <!--notice the two attributes
    - href = "" : this is used to hold that url(relative path or the abslute url)
    - target=" _blank" : this attribute specifies that we are targeting this url, and we want to open it in a new tab (by default the target is set to open as a
    next page, which is not what we want. We want users to stay on our website, and only leave in anotehr tab. Do not self-suicide!)
  -->

  <!--we can put multiple links for example, in p tags for block level styling (anchors are inline elements)-->
  <p>
    <a href="https://nfl.com/" target="_blank">NFL.com</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://nba.com/" target="_blank">NBA.com</a>
  </p>

  <!--images: use the img tag and then a src attribute which is the relative or absolute url/path to that image and then
  an alt attribute which basically explains the image on the screen, if the server cannot display the image
  <p>This is how the image displays in the broswer</p>
  <img src="./baybridge.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Images can actually be links! So if we clicked on this image, wed be navigated to a website about san francisco</p>
  -->

  <!--here is the source code for the image as a link and opening in a new tab with target blank as we have learned-->
  <p>Click the image to navigate to a wikipedia on the bay bridge!</p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco%E2%80%93Oakland_Bay_Bridge" target="_blank">
    <img src="./baybridge.jpg" alt="image-of-bridge-link">
